# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Mostly my estimates were just under the actual time taken. Occasionally, it was very out and I needed to spend alot more time on the problem than expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think my estimates became closer the more I completed the course, although there were still a few that surprised me.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to read the problem carefully to properly estimate the time it would take to complete. Before I would skim the question and guess how lomg it would take. Now I read it bit by bit and estimate how long something similar would take me. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I've learned that I seem to make the same simple mistakes repeatedly. by having someone else check it became easier to recognise the patterns of mistakes I was making. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

A lot of people make similar mistakes, I've even found mistakes in my own work by reviewing someone elses work. I think it's also really important to learn how other people read and interpreted the question.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 07 code review of prabJCU](https://github.com/prabJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This code review was very interesting to review because it was very clean and worked really well. However, some of the small issues were the "pass" at the end of if statements and some missing docstrings. I hadn't seen this "pass" in the teaching before so I noted that it could be removed.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 05 code review of jc972155](https://github.com/jc972155/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

This was my first code review so i learnt alot about how other people code and this one in particular was missing alot of docstrings. But it wsa very interesting to learn what to look for as mistakes or corrections. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think if the sample solutions had just the structure or a similar problem being solved it would be an insensitive people to learn and not just copy. Also having links to the guides throughout the pracs would be helpful so you knew exacly what to look for. When I was stuck I would spend a long time going through the Wiki without knowing what to look for.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

The pracs that I understood and enjoyed were completed really well. Even when it wasn't working I found the kivi practical very fun and I wanted to complete it and learn as much as possible. This is obviously subjective as not everyone will enjoy these as much as I did, but I think I did well to find something enjoyable in every prac so if nothing else I enjoyed that part of it.
