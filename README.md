### Subject: CP1404 – Programming II (James Cook University)

Throughout this subject, I’ve learned the importance of writing clean, readable, and reusable code. Some key lessons include:

Consistent naming and formatting: Using clear, descriptive variable and function names makes code easier to read and understand.

Separation of concerns: Keeping logic, data, and user interaction separate makes programs easier to maintain and test.

Code reuse and simplicity: Writing reusable functions and avoiding repetition reduces bugs and improves efficiency.
