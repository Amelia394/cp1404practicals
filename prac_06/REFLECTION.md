# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I'm doing alot more testing of outputs and more working in the consol to test different things. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Once I start a task I really need to finish it there and then. Because coming back to it hours or even days later means i have to waste time rereading the question and remembering what I was doing.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I'm learning the structure and layout really well.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Making sure my commits and docstrings are meaningful and in the right tense. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

The lectures being online has been difficult for me because sometimes I just don't watch the videos but when it's in person I get less distracted.
